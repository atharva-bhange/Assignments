A palindrome is a string of character that‘s the same forward and backward. 
Typically, punctuation, capitalization, and spaces are ignored. 
For example, “Poor Dan is in a droop” is a palindrome, as can
be seen by examining the characters “poor danisina droop” and observing that
they are the same forward and backward. One way to check for a palindrome is to reverse the
characters in the string and then compare with them the original-in a palindrome,
the sequence will be identical. Write C++ program with functions-

a)	To print original string followed by reversed string using stack
b)	To check whether given string is palindrome or not

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

void printOriginalAndReverse(string s)
{
    cout << "Original : " << s << endl;
    int s_len = s.length();
    char stack[s_len];
}

int main(void)
{
    return 0;
}
